This is a powerpoint plugin.  To build it, you'll need to have the MSTO plugins for VS and MS PowerPoint installed.  This was built with VS2010, against PowerPoint 2007 and 2010.

Building and starting a new instance as debug will install the plugin into your local PowerPoint.  To deploy properly, you'll need a trusted developer certificate.
